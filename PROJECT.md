# GHITA CODING AGENT — Project Context

> This file is the canonical **project charter** for the repository. It
> describes what the code in this monorepo actually builds and which
> phases are currently in flight. Historically this file contained the
> leftover notes of an unrelated "Scientific Document Correction" Python
> project — those notes were removed during the **PROJECT.md cleanup
> audit fix**.

## What this project is

GHITA CODING AGENT is a **multi-platform, AI-driven coding assistant**
delivered as a Turborepo + pnpm monorepo. It bundles a desktop app
(Tauri + React + Rust), a mobile companion app (React Native +
Kotlin), and a VS Code extension, all sharing a common workspace of
TypeScript packages for AI orchestration, security, memory, and skills.

The product is positioned as a local-first coding agent: the user keeps
their code on their own machine, the agent plans and edits inside that
workspace, and only model calls are sent to upstream providers through a
strictly-scoped proxy.

## Current focus (v0.1.5 Trust Hardening)

- Unified version **0.1.5**
- Honest tiered coverage gates (`docs/coverage-policy.md`)
- Security + agents critical-path tests
- Integrity CI job (version / artifacts / smells)

## Previous focus (Phase 11)

- **44/44 audit findings** closed (see `.agents/orchestrator/codebase_audit_report.md`).
- Coverage uses honest tier floors (see `docs/coverage-tiers.json`). Ship targets for core packages are raised only after measured coverage allows.
- Tauri shell hardened (CSP `frame-src`, IPC `GHITA_SESSION_TOKEN`, panic-free exit via `tauri::async_runtime::block_on`).
- Hard-coded credentials replaced with env-var driven configuration (`GHITA_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`, `GHITA_SESSION_TOKEN`, `GHITA_LIBERATE_PORTS`).

## Repository conventions

- **Node**: >= 20.x (pinned in `.nvmrc`).
- **Package manager**: pnpm 9.x with `workspaces` enabled.
- **Build orchestration**: Turborepo (`turbo.json`).
- **TS config**: strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` (`tsconfig.base.json`).
- **Lint / format**: ESLint flat config + Prettier (`eslint.config.js`).
- **Test**: Vitest (`vitest.config.ts`) with v8 coverage.
